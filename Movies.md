# Cyberpunk movies
Ready player one and Anita the battle angel are both great cyberpunk movies to talk about with this theme. Ready player one came out in 2018 and its about being in 2045 when the world is on the brink of chaos and the only way to escape is through the OASIS. the OASIS is an expansive virtual reality universe created by James Halliday. 

Alita battle angel is about a robot in the future found in a scrapeyard of iron city. She is rebuilt by a doctor and has no memory of her past life but soon begins to remember and tries to navigate through this new world.
